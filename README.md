# Matrix-Keyboard-Scanner
Matrix Keyboard Scanner using dsch3 and Microwind softwares.

The keyboard scanner was first simulated using dsch3 software.
A combination of 2-input and 4-input NAND gates were used to develop a 4:1 Encoder.
The gates were designed individually and implemented.
A transistor level simulation was then performed to verify output.
Finally, a layout was developed for fabrication using microwind software and waveforms were verified.
